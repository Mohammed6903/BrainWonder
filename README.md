## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Git
- 4GB+ RAM (for local Mistral model)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd brainWonders
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Setup environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Create .env file
   touch .env
   ```
   
   Add the following to your `.env` file:
   ```env
   # Local Mistral Model Path (after download)
   LLAMA_CPP_MODEL_PATH="/path/to/your/mistral-model.gguf"
   
   # API Keys (choose your preferred provider)
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_key_here
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key_here
   ```

5. **Download Mistral Model (Optional)**
   
   **Option A: Auto-download**
   ```bash
   python llama_test.py
   ```
   This will automatically download the model to your HuggingFace cache.
   
   **Option B: Manual download**
   - Visit: [https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instral-v0.2-GGUF/tree/main](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF/tree/main)
   - Download `mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q5_K_M.gguf`
   - Update `LLAMA_CPP_MODEL_PATH` in `.env`

### 🏃‍♂️ Running the Application

```bash
python main.py
```

The system will:
1. Load your conversation from `conversation.txt` (or use a fallback example)
2. Analyze career preferences using AI
3. Provide personalized career recommendations
4. Enter interactive mode for follow-up questions

## 🎮 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Direct Analysis
```python
from services.recommender import CareerRecommendationSystem
from llm.chatgpt import create_chatgpt

llm = create_chatgpt()
recommender = CareerRecommendationSystem(llm)

# you can also write the conversation in conversation.txt
conversation = """
I love solving puzzles and working with data. 
I enjoy programming and finding patterns in complex problems.
I prefer working independently but don't mind collaborating occasionally.
"""

result = recommender.full_recommendation_pipeline(conversation)
print(result['explanations'])
```

### Example 2: Interactive Session
```python
# Start interactive session
result = recommender.interactive_recommendation_pipeline(
    "I'm not sure what career path to choose..."
)

if result["status"] == "conversation_started":
    session_id = result["session_id"]
    
    # Continue conversation
    response = recommender.continue_conversation(
        "I enjoy helping people and working with technology",
        session_id
    )
```
